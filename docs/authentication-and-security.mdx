### LinkToken/AccessToken Exchange

You can think about our product as a gated neighborhood with locked houses, where each house represents a user's account. The `apiToken` allows you to enter the gated neighborhood and each house can be unlocked by its own unique `accessToken`. To interact with any accounts, you will use both the `apiToken` and `accessToken`.

The following process ensures your customers credentials are handled in a safe manner.

| Step | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `1`  | Your server calls `/link/token` to get a `linkToken`. The `linkToken` is a temporary token used by the client to allow users to connect an account on the frontend.                                                  |
| `2`  | Pass the `linkToken` to the Vessel Link component. In the `onSuccess` handler, Link will return a temporary `publicToken`. The `onSuccess` handler is called after the customer successfully connects their account. |
| `3`  | Call `/link/exchange` with the `publicToken` and exchange it for a permanent `accessToken`.                                                                                                                          |
| `4`  | Store the `accessToken` in a secure location. You will use it with your `apiToken` to interact with the account.                                                                                                     |
