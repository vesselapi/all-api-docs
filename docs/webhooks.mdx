Webhooks allow us to notify you when a relevant change has occurred in our system (or a downstream integration). This article contains only information relevant to Vessel webhooks; for a general overview of webhooks we recommend this [blog post](https://medium.com/hookdeck/webhooks-explained-what-are-webhooks-and-how-do-they-work-90c613c055a4).

### Important Notes

- Any time an object is updated/created/deleted, we'll send an event. You can use the `objectType` on the event payload to ignore objects that aren't relevant to your use case.
- You can only create **one** webhook per connection. It's very important to save the `webhookId` when you create a webhook as that’s how you’ll delete/change your webhook should you need to.
- Our webhooks are sent as `POST` requests over standard HTTPs and you must return `2xx` after receiving a webhook event.

## Managing Webhooks

| Description    | Endpoint             |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| Get webhook    | [GET /webhook](/)    |
| Create webhook | [POST /webhook](/)   |
| Delete webhook | [DELETE /webhook](/) |

## Event

The shape of the event we send to your `webhookUrl`

### Headers

<Param query='x-vessel-timestamp' type='string'>
  unix timestamp
</Param>
<Param query='x-vessel-signature' type='string'>
  signature for authentication
</Param>
<Param query='x-vessel-connection-id' type='string'>
  connectionId of this webhook
</Param>

### Body

General Shape of all events

```json
{
  "eventId": string,
  "type": string, // See event types below
  "data": object // See possible shape based on type below
}
```

_type="OBJECT_CHANGE"_

```json
{
  "eventId": string,
  "type": "OBJECT_CHANGE",
  "data": {
    "objectType": string, // "Contact" | "Account" | "Deal" | "Lead" | "User" | "Note" | "Task" | "Event" | "EventAttendee" | "Email"
    "eventType": string, // "DELETE" | "CREATE" | "UPDATE"
    "record": object
  }
}
```

_type="STATUS_CHANGE"_

```json
{
  "eventId": string,
  "type": "STATUS_CHANGE",
  "data": {
    "status": string; // "NEW_CONNECTION" | "INITIAL_SYNCED" | "READY"
  }
}
```

## Usage

Common use cases/patterns.

### Creating a webhook when an integration account is linked

You can easily establish webhooks when an account is linked by immediately POST-ing to the `/connection/webhook` endpoint after exchanging the `publicToken` for an `accessToken` Here's an example of a possible endpoint on your BE server responsible for exchanging the `publicToken` when a new account is linked.

```js
app.post('crm/link-account', async (req, res) => {
  const { accessToken } = await exchangeForAccessToken(req.body.publicToken)
  ...
  const { webhook } = await api.post('https://api.vessel.land/connection/webhook', {
    headers: {
      "vessel-api-token": API_TOKEN
    },
    bodyParams: {
      accessToken,
      webhook: {
        webhookUrl: WEBHOOK_URL
      }
    }
  })
  await saveWebhookMeta(webhook)
  ...
})
```

### Processing incoming webhook events

Here's a possible endpoint that's responsible for processing the webhook events sent by Vessel. As seen below, to generate the authentication signature take the sha256 of the `accessToken`, response body, and `x-vessel-timestamp`.

```js
const hash = (s: string) => crypto.createHash('sha256').update(s).digest('hex')

app.post(WEBHOOK_URL, async (req, res) => {
  const timestamp = req.headers['x-vessel-timestamp']
  const connectionId = req.headers['x-vessel-connection-id']
  const accessToken = await getAccessTokenForConnection(connectionId)
  const signature = `${accessToken}${JSON.stringify(req.body)}${timestamp}`

  if (hash(signature) !== req.headers["x-vessel-signature"]) {
    throw new Error("Unable to validate signature")
  }

  const event = req.body
  ...
  switch (event.type) {
    case "OBJECT_CHANGE":
      return processObjectChanges(event.data)
    case "STATUS_CHANGE":
      return processStatusChange(event.data)
  }
  ...

  // !!IMPORTANT!! Must return 2xx or Vessel will keep retrying
  return res.status(200)
})
```
