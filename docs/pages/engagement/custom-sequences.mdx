description: Learn how to build sequences that auto-enrich emails with data from your platform.
---

A common use case for the Sales Engagement APIs is to build a sequence for your user with emails that include data from your platform. This data could be a custom personalized message, a statistic that you generated, or any other custom text.

With the Vessel API, you can build this use case in a few simple steps, and also automatically enroll your customer's contacts into that sequence.

The best part is, you can use the Unified API to build out this use case for Apollo, Outreach, SalesLoft, and more all at once.

# Steps

## Step 1 - Create the Sequence

The first step is to create an empty sequence. We'll add the email templates and enroll contacts in it later.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.vessel.dev/unifications/engagement/sequences/create \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-vessel-api-token: [YOUR_API_TOKEN]' \
  --header 'x-vessel-access-token: [CUSTOMER_ACCESS_TOKEN]'\
  --data '{
  "sequence": {
    "name": "AI Personalized Emails",
    "shareType": "team",
  }
}'
```

```javascript Node (SDK)
const vessel = Vessel({
  apiToken: API_KEY,
  accessToken,
});

const data = await vessel.unifications.engagement.sequences.create({
  sequence: {
    name: "AI Personalized Emails",
    shareType: "team",
  },
});
console.log(data);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 2 - Create Custom Field(s)

Before you create the email templates in the sequence itself, you'll want to add some custom fields to the contacts. You can either ask your user to create the custom fields for you or you can use the API below to do it on their behalf.

These custom fields are what allow us to 'embed' your custom text into the emails that are sent out. You'll need to create a custom field for every piece of customized text that you want to add to the emails.

Also, please note that you'll need to make an exception for Outreach which doesn't allow for custom fields to be created. In the case that your customer connected Outreach, you'll need to use one of the predefined custom fields that Outreach provides. It's best practice to ask your user which custom field you can use to avoid accidentally overriding a custom field used by a different integration. This is the only special handling you'll need to do for this use case.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.vessel.dev/unifications/engagement/contacts/create-custom-field \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-vessel-api-token: ' \
  --header 'x-vessel-access-token: '\
  --data '{
  "customField": {
    "name": "acme_ai_personalization",
  }
}'

```

```javascript Node (SDK)
const vessel = Vessel({
  apiToken: API_KEY,
  accessToken,
});

// TODO: Check here to see if this is an Outreach connection,
// if that's the case, don't create a new custom field.
await vessel.unifications.engagement.contact.customFields.create({
  customField: {
    key: "acme_ai_personalization",
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

If you want to support Outreach but don't want to ask your user to provide a custom field for you, you can list the existing custom fields and pick one from there.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.vessel.dev/unifications/engagement/contacts/list-custom-fields \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-vessel-api-token: ' \
  --header 'x-vessel-access-token: '\
  --data '{}'
```

```javascript Node (SDK)
const vessel = Vessel({
  apiToken: API_KEY,
  accessToken,
});

const data = await vessel.unifications.engagement.contact.customFields.list({});
console.log(data);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 2 - Create the Sequence Steps

Next, you'll need to create the sequence steps which will include the email templates. There's a lot of customization that can go into creating a sequence step so make sure to check out the docs!

Sales Engagement Platforms use double bracket notation, e.g., `{{custom_field}}`, to inject dynamic data into outbound emails. We can leverage this and the custom field we made at the start to inject our own custom data into emails.

<warning>
  For the sake of unification, this endpoint can only be called **once** so make
  sure to include all the steps in this call.
</warning>

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.vessel.dev/unifications/engagement/sequence-steps/batch-create \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-vessel-api-token: ' \
  --header 'x-vessel-access-token: '\
  --data '{
  "sequenceId": "[SEQUENCE_ID_FROM_STEP_1]",
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Step 1 (Automated Email)",
      "type": "auto_email",
      "daysAfter": 0,
      "settings": {
        "templateName": "AI Email Template",
        "isReply": false,
        "subject": "Hello from {{company}}!",
        "body": "Hi {{first_name}}! {{acme_ai_personalization}}",
      }
    }
  ]
}'

```

```javascript Node (SDK)
const vessel = Vessel({
  apiToken: API_KEY,
  accessToken,
});

await vessel.unifications.engagement.sequenceSteps.batchCreate({
  sequenceId: "[SEQUENCE_ID_FROM_STEP_1]",
  steps: [
    {
      name: "Step 1 (Automated Email)",
      type: "auto_email",
      daysAfter: 0,
      settings: {
        templateName: "AI Email Template",
        isReply: false,
        subject: "Hello from {{company}}!",
        body: "Hi {{first_name}}! {{acme_ai_personalization}}",
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 3 - Get the Contacts

Now that we've got a sequence all created, it's time to add the customization to the contacts. You'll need to either create or find the contacts that you want to enrich by using the API below.

Note that there are a lot of different filtering options, don't try to enrich every contact in your customer's Sales Engagement Platform. In the example below, we're only getting the contacts that have a specific tag.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.vessel.dev/unifications/engagement/contacts/list \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-vessel-api-token: ' \
  --header 'x-vessel-access-token: '\
  --data '{
  "cursor": "123123",
  "filters": {
    "tagIds": {
      "in": ["some_tag"]
    },
  }
}'

```

```javascript Node (SDK)
const vessel = Vessel({
  apiToken: API_KEY,
  accessToken,
});

const data = await vessel.unifications.engagement.contacts.list({
  cursor: "123123",
  filters: {
    tagIds: {
      in: ["some_tag"],
    },
  },
});
console.log(data);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 4 - Enrich the Contacts

Next, fill in the custom field with the custom data. You'll need to do this for each contact that you want to enrich.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.vessel.dev/unifications/engagement/contacts/update \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-vessel-api-token: ' \
  --header 'x-vessel-access-token: '\
  --data '{
  "id": "[CONTACT_ID]",
  "contact": {
    "customFields": {
      "acme_ai_personalization": "[PERSONALIZATION]"
    },
  }
}'

```

```javascript Node (SDK)
const vessel = Vessel({
  apiToken: API_KEY,
  accessToken,
});

for (const contact of contacts) {
  await vessel.unifications.engagement.contacts.update({
    id: contact.id,
    contact: {
      customFields: {
        acme_ai_personalization: await getPersonalization(contact),
      },
    },
  });
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 5 - Find the User

Find the user that you want to send the emails out for, you can use the `email` property to match them with a user in your system.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.vessel.dev/unifications/engagement/users/list \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-vessel-api-token: ' \
  --header 'x-vessel-access-token: '\
  --data '{
  "cursor": "123123",
}'

```

```javascript Node (SDK)
const vessel = Vessel({
  apiToken: API_KEY,
  accessToken,
});

const data = await vessel.unifications.engagement.users.list({});
console.log(data);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 6 - Find the User's Email

Unlike most CRMs, Sales Engagement Users are not 1:1 to email addresses (called mailboxes). You'll need to find the email address that you want to send the emails from.

We recommend either allowing your user to pick the email they want to use or using the `default` email.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.vessel.dev/unifications/engagement/mailboxes/list \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-vessel-api-token: ' \
  --header 'x-vessel-access-token: '\
  --data '{
  "cursor": "123123",
}'
```

```javascript Node (SDK)
const vessel = Vessel({
  apiToken: API_KEY,
  accessToken,
});

const data = await vessel.unifications.engagement.mailboxes.list({});
console.log(data);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 7 - Enroll the Contacts

The last step is to enroll the contacts into the sequence. Unfortunately, there are no batch endpoints for this operation so you'll need to make a request for each contact - we recommend parallelizing this operation to speed it up.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.vessel.dev/unifications/engagement/sequence/start \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-vessel-api-token: ' \
  --header 'x-vessel-access-token: '\
  --data '{
  "id": "[SEQUENCE_ID_FROM_STEP_1]",
  "fields": {
    "contactId": "[CONTACT_ID]",
    "mailboxId": "[MAILBOX_ID]",
  }
}'

```

```javascript Node (SDK)
const vessel = Vessel({
  apiToken: API_KEY,
  accessToken,
});

for (const contact of contacts) {
  await vessel.unifications.engagement.sequence.start({
    id: "[SEQUENCE_ID_FROM_STEP_1]",
    fields: {
      contactId: contact.id,
      mailboxId: "[MAILBOX_ID]",
    },
  });
}
```
