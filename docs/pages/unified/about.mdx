# About

Unified APIs make it easy to build support for many integrations at once. Unified APIs provide a unified schema and data model meaning reading and writing data from multiple third party systems on behalf of your user is as easy as a single API call.

Our Unified APIs are passthrough meaning that no data is stored on our servers and data is fetched in real time.
