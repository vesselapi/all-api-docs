Unified APIs make it easy for you to build support for many integrations at once. Unified APIs provide a unified schema and data model that makes reading and writing data from multiple third party systems as easy as a single API call.

Our Unified APIs are "_passthrough_" APIs by default. This means that requests are sent directly to the end system in real-time, without any data being stored on our servers.
