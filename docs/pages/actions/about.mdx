# About

Actions are a first class interface for interacting with the integrations we support. Actions provide a significantly better developer experience than making a raw API call to the downstream platform by:

1. Validating API responses and request inputs with zod.
2. Providing well documented APIs so you don't need to refer to the downstream provider's documentation.
3. Applying standardization across common data types and fields
   3a. All dates are returned as ISO strings
   3b. All ids are returned as strings
4. Simplifing use cases for common workflows and handling common quirks in the integration.
5. [Future] Strongly typed SDK.

In general, actions are meant to make interfacing with downstream providers as effortless and efficient as possible making use cases like the Universal API and Managed ETL easy to build.

# OSS Repo
