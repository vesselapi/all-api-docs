title: "Unified APIs"
description: Integrate with one Vessel API to integrate with many integrations at once.
---

Unified APIs provide an abstraction on top of an entire vertical such as CRMs or Marketing Automation tools. Unified APIs make it easy to set up integrations with a large number of tools in a few lines of code by providing a single data schema and interface across common operations in a vertical.

## Support Unified APIs

Visit any of the pages below to see which integrations are part of which unified API.
