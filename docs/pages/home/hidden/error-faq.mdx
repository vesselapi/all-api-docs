## "Maximum number of connections reached for development account"

**Problem:**
Every Vessel customer is issued two API keys: A development API Key and a production API Key.
Development API keys are intended for testing and development purposes only and are allowed to make up to 5 connections.
If you encounter this error, you've exceeded the maximum number of allowed connections for your development API key.

**Solution:**
To remedy this problem, you can delete the development connections you're no longer using by following these steps:

1. List off all connections for your development API key by making an API call to [connection/connections](https://docs.vessel.dev/pages/crm/connection/get-all-connections) using your development API key.
2. Find the `connectionId` of the connection you want to delete.
3. Call DELETE [connection/connection](https://docs.vessel.dev/pages/crm/connection/remove-connection) with that `connectionId`.
