Step-by-step guide for creating an Apollo API key to connect to Apollo.

## Step 1: Navigate to the API key Page

Log-in to your Apollo account and navigate to the integrations page by clicking on your profile icon in the top right corner. There will be an "Integrations" page link near the bottom of the dropdown.

Give your API a name (e.g., Vessel API key) and a description (e.g., Used to connect to the Vessel API) and click "create API key".

**_Important_**: Ensure that the "Set as Master Key" toggle is set to true (it will be set to true by default). Do not select any of the APIs or toggle the Master Key off. Vessel can only connect via a Master Key.

## Step 3: Connect using your API key

Click on the copy API key button.
