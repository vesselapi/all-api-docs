Webhooks allow you to receive updates when something in our system changes.

### Important Notes

- **Very Important**: Webhooks will only be sent for objects which are using the [synced-cache](/pages/home/synced-cache).
- Any time an object is updated/created/deleted, we will send an event. You can use the `eventType` on the event payload to ignore objects that aren't relevant to your use case.
- Webhooks will only be sent in real-time if the downstream platform has native webhook support. Otherwise, you will still receive a webhook but it will be after the latest sync
- Our webhooks are sent as `POST` requests over standard HTTPs and you must return `2xx` after receiving a webhook event. We will re-send the webhook up to 3 times if we don't receive a `2xx` response.

## Add a Webhook

To add a webhook, you can use the [create webhook endpoint](/pages/home/api-reference/post-webhook.md).

Webhooks are added per-project (i.e., per-api-key) meaning that as soon as you add a webhook **you will start receiving webhooks for existing connections on that project**.

This also means there’s no need to add a new webhook every time you create a new connection. Just add one webhook and you’re good to go!

<CodeGroup>
```bash (API)
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.vessel.dev/webhooks/create \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-vessel-api-token: [API_KEY]' \
  --data '{
  "url": "https://mycompany.io/webhooks/12312312"
}'
```

```javascript (SDK)
const resp = await vessel.webhooks.create({
  url: "https://mycompany.com/webhook",
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### Webhook Body

Here’s the shape of the request that Vessel will make to your webhook endpoint when sending updates.

**Initial Sync**:
When we've finished pulling all of the data for a connection with Synced-cache enabled, we'll send an initial sync complete event.

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "x-vessel-project-id": "string",
    "x-vessel-timestamp": "number-string", // When we sent this event
    "x-vessel-webhook-id": "string",
    "x-vessel-webhook-signature": "string"
  },
  "body": {
    "connectionId": "string", // which connection this was for.
    "eventId": "string", // Unique event id. Used for debugging purposes.
    "eventTime": "date-string", // When this event occured
    "eventType": "system.sync.initial.complete"
  }
}
```

**Object Event**:
When an object in the synced-cache is updated/created/deleted, we'll send an event with the object id and type.

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "x-vessel-project-id": "string",
    "x-vessel-timestamp": "number-string", // When we sent this event
    "x-vessel-webhook-id": "string",
    "x-vessel-webhook-signature": "string"
  },
  "body": {
    "connectionId": "string", // which connection this was for.
    "eventId": "string", // Unique event id. Used for debugging purposes.
    "eventTime": "date-string", // When this event occurred
    "eventType": "object.crm.[deals|notes|accounts|...].[updated|created|deleted]", // ex: object.crm.deals.deleted
    "data": {
      "id": "string" // id of the record that was changed.
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>For object events, only the id of the affected object will be sent.</Note>

### Signature

It’s very important to verify the signature of the webhook in the header before processing the webhook. Vessel webhook signatures are generated using the following algorithm:

```jsx
const hash = (s: string) => crypto.createHash("sha256").update(s).digest("hex");

const signature = (response) => {
  const timestamp = response.headers["x-vessel-timestamp"];
  const body = JSON.stringify(response.body);
  return hash(`${process.env.VESSEL_API_TOKEN}:${timestamp}:${body}`);
};
```

## View Your Webhooks

Once you've added a webhook, you can view it in one of two ways:

### Through the API

By making an API call to the [list webhooks endpoint](/pages/home/api-reference/get-all-webhooks).

<CodeGroup>
```bash (API)
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.vessel.dev/webhooks/list \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-vessel-api-token: [API_KEY]' \
  --data '{}'
```

```javascript (SDK)
const resp = await vessel.webhooks.list();
```

</CodeGroup>

### In the Dashboard

You can view your webhooks in the dashboard under the 'webhooks' tab.
