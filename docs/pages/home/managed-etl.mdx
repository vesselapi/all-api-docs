## About

ETL is a process that involves extracting data from various sources and loading the transformed data into a target data warehouse or database.

### Managed ETL

With Vessel, this process is a breeze. We manage all the tricky parts that come with ETL such as the infrastructure, managing connections to the end platform, etc, all while giving you the flexibility to choose the schema most optimal to your use case - unified or native!
