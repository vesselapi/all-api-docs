## About

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It is a process that involves extracting data from various sources, transforming the data into a format that is suitable for analysis, and loading the transformed data into a target data warehouse or database.

Extract: Data is extracted from various sources, such as databases, APIs, and files.
Transform: The data is cleaned, processed, and transformed into a format suitable for analysis.
Load: The transformed data is loaded into a target database or data warehouse for analysis and reporting.
