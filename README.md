# API Documentation

Our public API documentation.

## Generation

Most of the docs are generated via a script. The only thing that needs to be hand-written and hand-updated are the `unified.yaml` files and anything in the `/crm` or `/home` directory.

Everything else should be generated by running:

```base Terminal
cd scripts; yarn build-docs
```

## Known issues

After you run the generation you might need to clean up the files a bit since there are some known issues that the generation can get stuck on:

1. `mint.json` might be ordered incorrectly, make sure everything abides by the `order` property
2. `*.yamls` might have garbage in their `examples`
